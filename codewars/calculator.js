/**
 * @function Calculator
 * 
 * @description Create a simple calculator that given a string of operators 
 * (+ - * and /) and numbers separated by spaces returns the value of that expression
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Calculator().evaluate("2 / 2 + 3 * 4 - 6") # => 7
 * 
 * Remember about the order of operations! 
 * Multiplications and divisions have a higher priority and should be performed 
 * left-to-right. 
 * Additions and subtractions have a lower priority and should also be 
 * performed left-to-right.
